# Changelog

Notable versions and key changes of `LocalMultiControl` / `DualRoleAdventure`. Entries up to v1.30 are translated from the original author's Chinese changelog; the fuller day-by-day history lives in `docs/archive/player-update-history.zh.md`.

## [Unreleased]

## [v1.33] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- Built-in Oddmelt compatibility: Oddmelt's hidden Gauge input cards (GaugeSummonActionCard /
  GaugeUltimateActionCard / GaugeBurstActionCard) are deliberately registered in no card pool, so
  rebuilding the combat hand UI on character switch called `NCard.Create` on them and hit
  "is not in any card pool!" (`InvalidProgramException`), rolling the switch back. A guard prefix on
  the game's `NCard.Create` (`NCardCreateHiddenCardGuardPatch`) now returns null for cards whose
  pool cannot be resolved; every caller already null-checks, so such cards are skipped exactly as
  Oddmelt intends. Without Oddmelt installed the guard is a no-op. This supersedes the separate
  `OddmeltGaugeCardRenderFix` mod, which is no longer needed.

## [v1.32] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- Local multiplayer: `[HarmonyPatch]` attributes placed only on methods (inside a class without a
  class-level `[HarmonyPatch]`) were silently skipped by `PatchAll`, so several patches never ran —
  including the combat card-selection foreground switch and the serialized hand selection. All patch
  classes now carry a class-level `[HarmonyPatch]` marker/target (`CardSelectForegroundSwitchPatch`,
  `NPlayerHandSelectCardsSerializationPatch`). Init now logs the patched-method census.
- Local multiplayer: `NPlayerHand.SelectCards` prefix no longer uses `ref bool __runOriginal`
  (Harmony 2.4.2 generated invalid wrapper IL for this method, crashing mod init with
  `InvalidProgramException`); it now uses the proven bool-return + `ref Task<...> __result` pattern.
- Local multiplayer: when two locally-controlled characters both need a hand-card choice at the same
  sync point (e.g. both characters holding the GensokyoSpire boss Utsuho's "Meltdown" buff select a
  card to exhaust at turn start), the second `NPlayerHand.SelectCards` overwrote the single shared
  `_selectionCompletionSource`, permanently orphaning the first choice and softlocking that character
  (unable to play cards or end turn). Combat hand selections are now serialized: only one selection is
  active at a time, the later one asynchronously waits its turn, and the foreground is switched to the
  selecting character right before its prompt is shown. The selection's owner is tracked per async
  chain from the `FromHand`/`FromSimpleGrid` entry (an `AsyncLocal` in
  `CardSelectForegroundSwitchPatch`), falling back to the triggering model's owner, so interleaved
  selections from both characters are each shown against the right hand. The wrapper's re-entry guard
  also uses an `AsyncLocal` so sibling `SelectCards` calls from the action executor are still serialized
  while the first prompt is on screen (`NPlayerHandSelectCardsSerializationPatch`).
- Local multiplayer: turn-end / turn-start card-choice effects belonging to a backgrounded
  character no longer hang or get skipped. The game builds `HookPlayerChoiceContext` with
  `LocalContext.NetId` as `_localPlayerId`, so when the last-visible character differs from the
  character whose choice is running, `_gameAction.OwnerId != _localPlayerId` and the hook action is
  never enqueued locally (`HookPlayerChoiceContext.cs:194/206`). The mod now:
  - Forces `_localPlayerId` to the choice owner inside every `HookPlayerChoiceContext` constructor
    (`HookPlayerChoiceContextLocalPatch`), so the choice is enqueued and runs on the loopback.
  - Auto-aligns the controlled foreground (hand / local context / top bar) to each character in the
    turn loop before `SetupPlayerTurn`, `DoTurnEnd` and `FlushPlayerHand`, and synchronously before
    `CardSelectCmd.FromHand`/`FromHandForUpgrade`/`FromSimpleGrid`/`FromChooseACardScreen`/
    `FromCombatPile`. The previous deferred (`CallDeferred`) foreground switch could miss the
    synchronous wait for the choice, so it has been replaced with a synchronous switch guarded by the
    same in-play/in-selection/target-selection checks (`CardSelectForegroundSwitchPatch`,
    `CombatManagerTurnHookForegroundPatch`, `LocalMultiControlRuntime.TryEnsureForegroundForPlayer`).
- Character switching during an in-progress card play / card selection no longer rolls back the
  control context; the combat UI refresh is deferred until the flow finishes (bounded retries), and a
  stuck off-screen end-turn button is re-animated in (`LocalMultiControlRuntime`).
- Hook actions (e.g. Mini-Hakkero's turn-end hand selection for a backgrounded character) switch the
  foreground to their owner at enqueue time, before the selection UI appears
  (`HookEnqueueForegroundPatch`).

### Adapted
- Game v0.111.0 (beta111, 2026-08-13). The mod previously failed to load with
  `ReflectionTypeLoadException`. Changes:
  - `INetGameService`/`INetHostGameService` gained net-new members in v0.111.0. The local
    loopback host service (`LocalLoopbackHostGameService`) now implements `LocalVersion`,
    `ClientConnectionFailed` and `GetVersionInfoForPeer`.
  - `LoadRunLobbyPlayer` replaced its `versionInfo` field with a flat `isModded` bool; the
    load-lobby auto-ready patch now writes `isModded` from the net service's local version.
  - `StartRunLobby.MaxPlayers` was replaced by a constructor-injected readonly `_maxPlayers`
    (no auto-property backing field). Local self-coop lobbies are now created at the full 12-player
    capacity up front and the reflection-based `EnsureLobbyMaxCapacity` resize was removed.
  - `CombatManager`'s ready-to-begin-enemy-turn set moved onto the turn state; the ready-set lookup
    tries the new location first and falls back to the pre-beta110 field.

## [v1.31] - 2026-07-27

First community-maintained release. The original author (liwenhao0427) discontinued
maintenance at v1.30 and gave written permission (2026-07-27, email) for this fork to
take over maintenance and distribution; they will cross-link this version from the
original Workshop item and video.

> Note (2026-08-21): the paragraph above is preserved from the v1.31 release notes written by
> the previous maintainer (GuyGinat). The current maintainer has not verified that
> authorization and makes no such claim.

### Added
- Optional "ghost hands" combat overlay: shows every backgrounded character's current hand as rows of non-interactive cards behind and above the active character's hand. Toggle with `F8`; move the display at runtime with `Ctrl+Arrows` (`Ctrl+Shift+Arrows` for fine 4px steps). State, position and scale persist to `user://dual_role_adventure_settings.json` (edit `ghostHandsScale` there to resize; default 0.5). Card nodes are borrowed from and returned to the game's own `NodePool`.

### Changed
- Character switching is now bound to `Tab` (next) and `Shift+Tab` (previous). The legacy keys — `]` / `R` / `/` for next, `[` / `T` for previous — still work as aliases.
- Documentation translated to English; original Chinese documents archived under `docs/archive/`.

### Fixed
- Adapted to game v0.109.0 (2026-07-17); five compile-level API breaks since the v1.30 baseline:
  - `VoteToMoveToNextActAction` gained a required `currentActIndex` parameter; the act-change auto-ready patch now passes `RunState.CurrentActIndex`, mirroring the game's own call site.
  - `PotionFactory.CreateRandomPotionsOutOfCombat` now returns `IEnumerable<PotionModel>`; the local merchant inventory rebuild materializes it with `.ToList()` like the game does.
  - `Controller` input constants were renamed (`joystick*` → `lStick*`, `dPad{East,West,North,South}` → `dPad{Right,Left,Up,Down}`); updated the gamepad axis router and the character-select hotkey hint icons.
  - `EventModel.GenerateInternalCombatState(runState)` was removed; rebuilding a non-shared combat-layout event room on character switch now calls `EventSynchronizer.GenerateInternalCombatStateIfNecessary(event)` instead.
- Local Multi-Control entry unreachable on fresh profiles: since v0.109.0, pressing Host with `Progress.NumberOfRuns == 0` skips the host submenu and immediately hosts a Standard online game, so the injected card never appeared. A new prefix on `NMultiplayerSubmenu.OnHostPressed` routes fresh profiles through the host submenu (its Standard card keeps the one-click hosting behavior).

### Notes
- `NRestSiteRoom.UpdateNavigation` no longer exists in v0.109.0; the rest-site controller focus recovery already guarded that lookup with a null-conditional call, so it degrades to the mod's own focus-grab fallback.
- Static sweep of all string-based Harmony/reflection targets against decompiled v0.109.0 source: everything else resolves (the two `BeginRunIfAllPlayersReady` misses are the intentional legacy-name fallback legs).

## [v1.30] - 2026-06-19

Final release by the original author. (Summarized from the archived player-update history.)

### Fixed
- Adapted to the game's 1.0 release: treasure rooms no longer black-screen (the removed `IsSinglePlayerOrFakeMultiplayer` API is no longer called; the chest gesture layer works with the new vote structure, with a focus guard for first-frame relic nodes).
- Shop inventory switching adapted to the new `Inventories` structure; ESC quick-restart moved to the release version's load method.
- Loading a multi-character save resumes correctly (`BeginRunForAllPlayersIfAllReady` with a reflection fallback to the legacy `BeginRunIfAllPlayersReady`).
- Reward synchronizer local-player checks (`RewardsSetSynchronizer`) are re-synced on character switch, fixing "clicked a relic reward, nothing happened" in the beta.

## [v1.17] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- Reworked the loot phase: rewards are generated independently per character, then presented as one combined list with a per-character prefix label.
- Relic-doubling effects, shop-quality factors, and hunt-style card effects now apply per owning character.
- Removed the old resource-mirroring logic; relic/potion/gold mirroring in loot scenes is suppressed by the aggregated flow.

## [v1.10] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- Vakuu auto-switch could miss its trigger: added a per-frame fallback that switches to the next controllable non-Vakuu character when no Vakuu character has a playable card.
- Standardized the English spelling `Vakuu`.

### Changed
- Vakuu toggle hint text unified across mouse and controller paths, localized in Chinese and English (single: "Vakuu will control Player X"; all: "Vakuu will control all characters").

## [v1.09] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Controller combos on the character-select screen: `Y` toggles Vakuu for the highlighted character, `LT + Y` toggles all.
- Controller hotkey hint icons on the select screen (`LT + D-pad`, `Y`, `LT + Y`), shown only in controller mode like the base game.
- Full LT-combo input chain: while LT is held, native controller input is intercepted; on release, the original LT action replays only if no combo was used.

## [v1.06] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Potions are now maintained per character instead of being pinned to slot 1.
- Removed the special "+2 initial potion slots" rule; potion slots match online multiplayer behavior.
- The top potion bar follows the currently controlled character after switching and stays directly usable.

## [v1.05] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Removed a duplicate copy path in the treasure chest patch that could double-copy in a single settlement.
- Chest relic copying now de-duplicates against already-owned relics.
- Treasure-map settlement handled once for the whole party, with automatic view switching during Vakuu flows.

## [v0.1.9] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Rest sites no longer occasionally auto-upgrade a random card and end without manual selection; manual card selection outside combat restored.
- Rest sites run strictly serially: each character chooses once before the site ends — no more skipped characters.
- Event branches that upgrade/remove cards process every unfinished character with the same option, one by one.
- Mouse visibility restored after switching characters at a treasure chest.

## [v0.1.3] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- Combat character-switch buttons redesigned as pure icons with scaling and right-side mirroring.
- Character-select 2x2 button group rearranged to match combat-screen interaction style.
- Multiple rounds of screenshot-driven tuning: arrow positions, margins, horizontal spacing, readability.

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- Release process upgraded to support "fast releases" (publish directly from existing artifacts in the project root).

## [v0.1.1-clearable] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- Combat top-bar display glitch on entering combat.
- Shared-event auto-voting flow blockage.

## [v0.1.0-initial-usable] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Minimal usable loop for local multi-control.
- Basic input switching, key synchronization chains, and the core patch framework.
